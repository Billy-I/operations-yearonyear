### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Partial) ✅

1. **Variable Costs Analysis Features**

   - Added market range visualization with:
     - Wide gray bars showing market range (min to max)
     - Colored bars (red/green) showing current costs
     - Dashed lines indicating market averages
     - Clear legend explaining visual elements
   - Implemented chemical subcategories drill-down
   - Added percentage variance calculations
   - Added comprehensive tooltips showing costs and variances

2. **Financial Impact View Features**

   - Implemented waterfall chart
   - Added supporting metrics panel
   - Created gross/net margin calculations

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Added detailed tooltips
   - Implemented drill-down functionality

## In Progress

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Remaining)

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Benchmark data loading and caching
   - Chart rendering optimization
   - State management improvements

2. **Data Integration**
   - Connect to real benchmark data
   - Implement data fetching logic
   - Add loading states

### Phase 3: Refinement

1. **Visual Improvements**

   - Add transitions between views
   - Enhance responsive behavior
   - Refine chart styling
   - Optimize visual hierarchy in Variable Costs view

2. **Testing**

   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests
   - Test edge cases and error handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Create component documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document data structure requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks**

   - Add loading states for data fetching
   - Implement transitions between views
   - Add error handling for data loading
   - Further refine Variable Costs visualization:
     - Add percentage labels above bars
     - Improve market range visibility
     - Enhance tooltip content

2. **Testing Priority**

   - Write unit tests for core components
   - Test view transitions and state management
   - Validate calculations and data transformations

3. **Documentation Tasks**

   - Create usage guidelines
   - Add inline code comments

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**

   - Large datasets may cause rendering delays
   - Need to implement data memoization
   - View transitions could be smoother

2. **Data Handling**

   - Need to add validation for benchmark data
   - Error states for missing or invalid data
   - Better handling of null/undefined values

3. **UI/UX**
   - Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
   - Tooltip positioning could be optimized
   - Some chart elements need better contrast
   - Variable Costs view could be more intuitive

## Future Improvements
